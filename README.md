# Retro Playlist Generator

## Running

Before running the app, you must initialize a "virtual environment" for Python and install dependencies.

```
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The script may differ on systems other than Windows.

After that, you may run the program with `python src/main.py`
